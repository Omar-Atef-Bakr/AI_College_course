## 8-Puzzle-Solver

### Description
The 8-Puzzle Solver is the first project in our AI course. It involves implementing algorithms to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and a blank space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from their initial state to a goal state using the minimum number of moves using different algorithms like BFS, DFS and A*. 

### Project Components
1. **8-Puzzle Solver Algorithm:**
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Implement BFS algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle problem.
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Implement DFS algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle problem.
   - **A* Search Algorithm:** Implement A* search algorithm with heuristic functions to find an optimal solution.

2. **Code Files:**
   - `8_puzzle_solver.ipynb`: Contains the main logic for the 8-puzzle solver.

3. **Heuristic Functions:**
   - **Manhattan Distance:** Implement a heuristic function based on Manhattan distance.
   - **Euclidean Distance:** Implement a heuristic function based on Euclidean distance.

### Files Included
- `8_puzzle_solver.ipynb`: Main program file to interact with the user and solve the 8-puzzle.
